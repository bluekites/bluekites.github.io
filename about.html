      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I'm an aspiring <b>web developer</b> and <b>UX designer</b>.  My main goal is to satisfy all of your web development needs, and yes, I do design too!  If there is a web app that needs to be built, I can build it!</p>

      <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
      <p>I am originally from Taipei, Taiwan.  I came to the United States at the age of 10 and have been here ever since.  
    I am a graduate from UC Davis and am currently residing in Irvine, California.  
        Irvine is a clean, quiet city that satisfies pretty much all my requirements for an ideal living area.  It is close to the beach, has a very diverse selection of cultural cuisines, and most important of all, it has <b>AMAZING</b> boba cafes!</p>

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <h4>What is important to you?</h4>
      <p>Work and life, ideally a good balance between the two!  Without work I'd just get bored, and without life well, it's just sad!  Along with that comes good food.  The motivation of trying out exotic and delicious cuisines day after day actually allows for me to excel in all facets of work and life!  <br><br>
        When it comes to coding however, the most important thing to me is to write <b>clean</b> and <b>elegant</b> code.  Any code that causes confusion for my colleagues is a failure in my book!</p>
      <h4>What are your favorite hobbies?</h4>
      <p>I am a bit of a gym enthusiast that is currently very interested in calisthenics.  My biggest hobby however(aside from web development) is to comb through Yelp for the newest and best restaurants around!</p>
      <h4>What is your dream job?</h4>
      <p>My dream job would be anything I can call my hobby, which web development definitely fits the criteria.  My ultimate goal would be to achieve a  successful freelancing career where I can better manage the balance between my life and my job.</p>
      <h4>What music have you been listening to recently?</h4>
      <p><b>Discretion!</b>  I am a nerd when it comes to video games and animated series!  I listen to plenty of soundtracks from aforementioned sources when I either need to focus on a task or just relax in general.</p>
